# HOTEL BOOKING WEBPAGE

I copied this hotel landing page using FIGMA. It has **only a desktop view** without responsiveness because it's a basic level html project.
I added the **meta tag** and **open graph tag** to improve the social share visibility and the SEO.

I used **toggle** and **trello** to time and organize the different steps of building of my project.

###### Languages used:
- **HTML**

- **CSS**
